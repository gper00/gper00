<h1>Hi there, I'm <a href="https://github.com/devChampl00">ijii</a> ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I love exploring web development, especially JavaScript technologies, and Iâ€™m always excited to learn and build cool stuff. Iâ€™m also into sports like football ofcourse and working out lilbit to stay active and push my limits.

Another thing I really enjoy is playing chess, itâ€™s both fun and challenging. If youâ€™re up for a game, Iâ€™d be more than happy to play!
