# Hi there, I'm [ijii](https://github.com/gper00) ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Informatics Engineering student with a passion for exploring web development, especially JavaScript technologies. I'm always excited to learn and build cool stuff. I'm also into sports like football (of course!) and working out a little to stay active and push my limits.

Another thing I really enjoy is playing chess â€” it's both fun and challenging. If you're up for a game, I'd be more than happy to play!
